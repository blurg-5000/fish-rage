# Fish Rage

## What is Fish Rage?

Fish Rage is a game which was developed during the "Idea Fusioner Hackathon" held at Dev Academy Aotearoa in October of 2024. This was a social hackathon where each team drew 2 random ideas from a hat, and had to make a project incorporating both ideas. We pulled "Boats" and "Cryptids", so decided to make a fishing game.

## How to play

The project is currently not deployed as we'd like to polish a few things first, but the game in its current state can be played by doing the following from your command line:

* Clone this repo and `cd` into the folder
* Run `npm i` to install the required packages
* Run `npm run knex migrate:latest && npm run knex seed:run` to set up the database
* Run `npm run dev` to start the server
* Navigate to [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173) in your browser

## Key technology we used

* Tailwind
* Typescript
* Knex & sqlite3
